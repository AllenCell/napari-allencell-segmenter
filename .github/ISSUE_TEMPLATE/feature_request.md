## Requested feature
*Describe the new feature you would like to see in the napari-segmenter plugin.*

## Use case
*What will this change enable you to do?*

## If this change is NOT made...
Check all that apply, by entering an x inside the brackets in edit mode or clicking on the checkbox in preview mode:
- [ ] I will not use the napari-segmenter plugin.
- [ ] I will be blocked from completing my current tasks.
- [ ] I can accomplish what I need to accomplish, but it’s tedious.
- [ ] Not a problem right this minute, but this is going to be a problem soon.
- [ ] Everything’s fine! But it would be cool if this work happened at some point in the future.

## Alternatives
*Are there any other plugins or software that you would use in place of this feature?*
